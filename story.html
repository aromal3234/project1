          <h3>The Beginning</h3>
          <p>The story of how we met is completely unexpected.
            I'm Aromal, and she is Uthara.
We met through one of our common friend, Appu — he's my best friend, and Uthara is his friend. Appu used to talk about Uthara many times, so I knew a bit about her, just like I knew about his other friends.
One day, Appu went to Uthara's school, and during the journey, he called me as usual. At that time, Uthara was also with him. During our call, she interrupted for fun, and we ended up talking casually and joking around. That was the first time we spoke.💫</p>

          <h3>Getting to Know You</h3>
          <p>This happened during our Plus Two days, back in 2023.
After that, I followed Uthara on Instagram, and from then on, we were friends there — but we never messaged each other.
Days turned into months, and months into years. We both joined different colleges.🦋</p>

          <h3>Growing Together</h3>
          <p>Then one day, after several months, I posted a random gym video on my Instagram story. I got many reactions and comments from different people — and among them was a funny reply from Uthara. I replied casually, but somehow, that day felt different. I don't know why, but I felt a special connection with her.🌱</p>

          <h3>Today & Tomorrow</h3>
          <p>After that, I found myself wanting to talk to her more. I started finding small reasons just to start conversations — and soon, our chats became non-stop, day and night, for months. ✨</p>

          <h3>Growing Together</h3>
          <p>One day, I realized that I had to tell her how I truly felt. I was nervous and anxious about how she might respond. After a roller coaster of emotions, I finally told her that I loved her. 🌱</p>

          <h3>Growing Together</h3>
          <p> Her reply was kind of positive — and even though I had to wait a few days for her final answer, we kept talking, and our late-night calls became a beautiful routine.
Then, on May 13, 2025, she said yes. ❤️
